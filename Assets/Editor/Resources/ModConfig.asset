  description: "A very easy defuser-oriented module where you have to repeat a sequence
    of squares back after only seeing them for one second. The module consists of
    four stages, with 3, 5, 7, and 9 squares respectively.\r\n\r\nEstimated Difficulty:
    1/10 (very easy for defuser / effortless for expert)\r\n\r\nWhile the whole \"four
    stages\" thing might seem off-putting, the module could take as little as 10-20
    seconds to completely solve.\n\nImplemented by: KingSlendy\r\nOriginal idea made
